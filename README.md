# LLM based custom quiz maker from lecture notes

Reviewing lecture notes effectively can be a real challenge. I faced this problem myself and decided to create an app that lets you do that. Upload your lecture notes and have interactive quiz to practice using LLM.

# Demo

# Working

1. The uploaded PDF is parsed using PyPDF2. Images in the PDF are extracted and summarized separately with PIL and OpenAI.
2. The parsed content from PDF is broken down into fixed size chunks and summarized.
3. These chunks are sent to LLM (OpenAI GPT 4o mini) to create quiz. I'm using structured output to generate MCQ questions and options.
4. This output is used to create an interactive quiz.

# Setup

Environment setup:
```sh
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
export OPEN_API_KEY="key"
```

Starting streamlit server
```sh
streamlit run app.py
```
